## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- javaScript

# ResumeBuilder

A web application for building resumes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What I Learned

### HTML & CSS:
- I learned that `align-items` and `justify-content` only work when the parent element has `display: flex` set. These properties help in aligning and distributing items within a flex container.
  
- I learned to use `rem` (root em) for sizing elements, instead of using `%` everywhere. `rem` is relative to the root font size and provides more consistent and scalable design across different screen sizes.

- I learned that `padding` plays a key role in adjusting the size of elements, helping to maintain spacing and ensure that elements have the required dimensions without affecting their layout.

### JavaScript:
- I learned how to use JavaScript to add interactivity to the ResumeBuilder page. This includes form validation, dynamically updating content, and handling user inputs efficiently.

- I explored how to manipulate DOM elements, such as adding event listeners to buttons and inputs, to trigger actions like saving the form data or updating the UI without needing to refresh the page.

- I learned to use functions and conditionals to create a more dynamic user experience, such as displaying error messages when a form input is invalid or providing feedback when an action is completed.

- I also gained a deeper understanding of how to work with JavaScript objects and arrays to manage data, and how to loop through these structures to generate or display content dynamically on the page.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codingexport/ResumeBuilder.git


### Continued development

I still need to practice the positioning an element more. I also need to learn about CSS in general & HTML5 rules.
